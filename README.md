This will be added in the future.

### Emotes

Currently, the mod supports 7TV and FrankerFaceZ emotes.
They can be used by typing `emote_name` in chat.
For example, `peepoHey` will be replaced with the ![peepoHey](https://cdn.7tv.app/emote/60aeec1712d7701491f89cf5/1x.gif) emote.

**Warning:** This is only client-side, so other players will only see the emote if they have the mod installed.
